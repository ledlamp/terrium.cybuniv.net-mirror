				I played this recently and realized that it&#039;s ready for regular beta testers. I&#039;m going to play it regularly and would like people to play with. I left Mars for good and just want to focus on getting Terrium up. Let&#039;s do this people!

				We are definitely still developing! Terrium is not close to being ready for beta testers, though – we&#039;re at best in an alpha stage of development. Please don&#039;t recruit beta testers yet. :P (We&#039;ll let you know when we&#039;re ready.)

				I see. Why not have regular Alfa testers? I am going through Mars withdrawal, Eric! I need my Dogfights! I need them!

				Dogfighting does not work in Terrium right now due to scores not being recorded properly. You can still dogfight without scores by all means, but there are still quite a few bugs. I&#039;m not entirely sure which version Eric currently has uploaded, but I&#039;ll warn you that there were a few SERIOUS bugs only a week or so ago, so you may encounter problems.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s not ready for Beta yet but by all means play around!<br /><br /><br />And we&#039;re working as hard as we can to get it ready for full-time play, so if your lungs can last you up to a few months, you can start holding your breath for the first version ;)
