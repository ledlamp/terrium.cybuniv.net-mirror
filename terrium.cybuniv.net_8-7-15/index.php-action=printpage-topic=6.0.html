				*Note* If you are unfamiliar with SMF, read http://terrium.cybuniv.com/index.php?action=help (http://terrium.cybuniv.com/index.php?action=help) to learn this forum&#039;s capabilities.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size">Global Forum Rules:<br /></span></strong> <br /><span class="bbc_u">Introduction:<br /></span> <br />The forum staff reserve the right to interpret and enforce the rules at their own discretion. <br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u">Punishment:</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. If a post contains minor infractions upon the rules, the moderators will issue a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. If a user repeatedly breaks the posting rules, the infringing posts may be removed without notice.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. If a post seriously breaks the above set of rules, it will be removed without notice, and the responsible user may be banned. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Rule 1</span>: All posts must be typed in English with the niceties of spelling and grammar. Perfection is not necessary. Rather, make sure you write intelligibly and with care. (Tips: Use spell check and reread what you typed at least a couple times.)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Rule 2</span>: No posts without merit, lacking content, with profanity, advertisement, solicitation, personal agendas, offensive/inappropriate material, or malicious intent. Avoid writing posts containing strong or hurtful language.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Rule 3</span>: Posts must have relevant links and titles. Thread titles and content must be descriptive and specific. This is to prevent spam, confusion, and inconvenience. (e.g. Generic titles like, “Help please,” “Tutorial Request,” and, “I’m New” are not allowed.)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Rule 4</span>: Each person is restricted to possessing one forum account. Send a PM to a moderator or administrator if you need an exception (e.g. switching accounts).<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Rule 5</span>: When reporting people or a problem, please take pictures and provide the evidence via PM to a moderator. Do not make it public.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size">Forum Etiquette:<br /></span></strong><br />1. Want to ask a <strong>question</strong>? First, read the FAQ before posting. Then, search (upper right hand corner of this page) for keywords related to your question to find if it has been answered before. Try to post questions in the questions and responses thread. If the question is complex and merits discussion, make an individual post. <br /><br /><br />2. Want to talk about a <strong>bug</strong> or <strong>glitch</strong>? First, report a bug (http://terrium.cybuniv.com/index.php?board=5.0) before posting about it. If you need additional help, go ahead and post!<br /><br /><br />3. Have an <strong>idea</strong> or <strong>suggestion</strong>? If it is simple, go ahead and comment on ideas and suggestions. If it is more complex, you may go ahead and post it, provided there is enough content to justify an individual post.<br /><br /><br />4. <strong>Flaming is not tolerated.</strong> We respect each other and other communities. There is to be no fighting on the forum.<br /><br /><br />5. <strong>Never ask for reputation (rep).</strong> Reputation is to be handed out, at the forum members’ discretion, as a reward for adding quality content to a thread, or the forum in general. Reputation abuse is punished.<br /><br /><br />6. <strong>Reviving old and irrelevant posts (dubbed “grave digging”) will result in said posts being promptly resolved.</strong> If a post is important to the forum but &#039;dead,&#039; it will not qualify as irrelevant, and thus will remain active.<br /><br /><br />7. <strong>Do not feed the trolls.</strong> Ignore them, and let a mod handle the situation. (Same rule applies with spam.)<br /><br /><br />8. <strong>Credit people</strong> for their work when posting links, pictures, etc. Never accredit yourself with someone else’s work, and do not create similar or duplicate threads.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lastly...<br />...and most importantly...<br /><strong>HAVE FUN!</strong><br />(This is an outline and first draft of the global forum rules. Keep in mind that each board will have its own specific rules. Please share your questions, comments, and concerns!)

				Wow, I like the upgraded vehicles! I have found a glitch though. When you switch from vehicle to vehicle, it creates a copy, so if I switch from buggy to tank to jet, all three will be in at the same time. They will also react to me pressing the arrow keys to move, (So all vehicles will move forward if I fly forward using one.) <br /><br />By the way, its nice to see what your up to. <br /><br />Your cousin (Alex) told me that you got the rights to MXPLR. Nicely done!

I would have hundreds of hovercrfat and buggy duplicates that would all follow my controls. When they spawn they would explode out. This is how i made my flying hovercrafts xD Also sometimes the camera would choose a different duplicate to follow lol<br /><br />

				That bug has been fixed... I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s in the web version still, though. I don&#039;t know when Eric updates it.
