				Part 1: The Set Up<br /><br />First, you need an idea. I&#039;m making a simple hilly world.<br /><br />Then, you need unity 2.6. You can get that here:<br /><br />http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/UnitySetup-2.6.0.exe<br /><br />Once you install it, open it up. <br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/1.png)<br /><br />That&#039;s what Unity looks like. Before you do anything else, you also need Whirld 3. Download it here:<br /><br />http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/100215%20Whirld.unitypackage<br /><br />Then run the program by clicking on it while Unity is open.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/2.png)<br /><br />Then click &quot;Import&quot;<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/3.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Another thing you need to do before working on the world is to open up a previous world. This allows you to set the spawn point and change the description, plus it makes things easier for me or others to export.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/4.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/5.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/6.png)<br /><br />Click on it to open it.<br /><br />Obviously, you don&#039;t want levitashia in there. Notice the red circle:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/7.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />This is the Hirearchy. It displays what is in your scene. (AKA, whats in the world currently.) You want to delete everything except for the Base and World.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/8.png)<br /><br />It should look like this.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/9.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />If you can see the skybox (the background) and fog, it would be easier to turn them off for now. Click the following buttons.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/10.png)<br /><br />The picture displays the background and the lightbulb displays light. Turn them both off.<br /><br />Part 2: Creation Time..?<br /><br />Now it&#039;s time for you to create a terrain. Click on Terrain-Create Terrain.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/11.png)<br /><br />This should create a blank sheet in the scene. Notice to the right in the Hirearchy and the inspector.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/12.png)<br /><br />The Inspector displays the properties of the object you have selected. Notice the tools:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/13.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />What each does:<br /><br />Red: Molds the terrain upward. Holding shift will lower the terrain.<br />Orange: This will mold the terrain to a specific height. Holding shift sets the point.<br />Yellow: Smooths the terrain. Use this when it&#039;s too bumpy.<br />Green: This one paints the terrain with textures. We&#039;ll go into it in a bit.<br />Blue: This manages your trees just like the Green manages your textures.<br />Dark Blue: This manages 2d grass and such, just like Blue and Green.<br />Purple: This manages the terrain settings, but it&#039;s best to leave these alone for your first world.<br /><br />Now would be a good time to test out the terrain. Click on the (red) tool and you will see this pop up:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/14.png)<br /><br />The yellow is pretty streight forward, and the green will adjust the power, or strength, of your brush. The Red displays all of the amazing brushes you have to choose from. Select a brush and draw on the terrain. You may notice it&#039;s very similar to painting a picture.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/15.png)<br /><br />As you can see, it looks dull because there are no textures loaded. Click on the Paintbrush (yellow) tool. <br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/16.png)<br /><br />(Note: Target Strength limits the opacity)<br /><br />Click on the &quot;Edit Textures&quot; (Green box above)<br /><br />Then Add Texture<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/17.png)<br /><br />This will pop up:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/18.png)<br /><br />The Yellow will stretch or squish accordingly, and the Red is where you choose your texture. Click on the Red box to choose. This will pop up:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/19.png)<br /><br />As you can see, it loads every image available, and not all are textures. I have outlined in Yellow those that are actual textures. You can use these, but I strongly suggest you do not, or else it will look like everyone elses world. <br /><br />How do you get more textures? GOOGLE IMAGES! Search for textures you want, but make sure you include the word &quot;seamless&quot; in your search, or else the textures will not look smooth at all. If you find a texture that is not smooth, I have written another tutorial on making it seamless:<br /><br />http://marsxplr.com/view-9781<br /><br />PRO TIP: Make sure they are +512x512 (They HAVE to be divisible by four and square) for detail.<br /><br />These are the textures I will be using:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/20.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/21.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/22.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/23.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/24.png)<br /><br />To put them in Unity, simply drag the files in.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/25.png)<br /><br />&nbsp;Now add them to your texture list.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/26.png)<br /><br />&nbsp;Now you can begin modelling.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/27.png) <br /><br />I usually make things a little higher to create an island. Do this by raising the terrain a bit, then shift clicking with the (orange tool), then draw the rest to create an island.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/28.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Before we add our sea, we need to make sure the default scripts are gone. They mess up the terrain as well as exporting.<br /><br />Locate these files, then delete:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/Scripts.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />The Sea that you can use is located here:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/29.png) <br /><br />Click and drag into your scene. Position it the following:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/30.png) <br /><br />The position is, well, the position. X&amp;Z handle the horizontal and Y handles the verticle. About 10 units high is good. <br /><br />Also, it would be a good idea to set the X and Z scale to around 10-100. I personally prefer 100 to have an endless ocean, but others like it 10.This is what it should look like:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/31.png)<br /><br />After I began painting and scaling, I realized the &quot;Grass Rock&quot; texture did not fit. (Northern most)<br />&nbsp;<br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/33.png)<br /><br />So I created a new one by combining the rock with the grass.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/34.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Another thing you can see from the picture above the new texture is that you can see when the textures copy. This is a technique you should heavily consider when painting your textures: <br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/35.png) <br /><br />To avoid it looking like this: (This is a DO NOT!!!!!) <br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/36.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />See how it doubles? BAD! The above method also gives it a more natural feel. <br /><br />Part 3: COMPLETION..?<br /><br />Once your terrain is nearing it&#039;s completion, there is a few things that need to do before it can be exported.<br /><br />One of these is to add a floor. A lot of worlds recently have ignored this step, possibly because they do not know how. Find the following file in your Project panel:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/38.png) <br /><br />And click and drag just like the water. It should also have the exact same specifications as the water with the exception of the Y position. This should be set to 0.<br /><br />Then select the following in the Hirearchy:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/39.png) <br /><br />Then look at the inspector.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/40.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Change this texture to your bottom texture.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/41.png) <br /><br />Now, click on the parent (Folder above) object in the Hirearchy. Then click and drag the texture into the following area:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/42.png)<br /><br />&nbsp;Then, click on &quot;world&quot; in the hirearchy.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/43.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />The Purple is the welcome message that displays when you join the world. Edit that to how you like. The Blue, however, are the default settings. (And these are CRAP!) Change to the following:<br /><br />mmap:1;camo:0;wvis:8000;lsrh:0;lspd:200;lgvt:0;bugen:1;tnken:1;hvren:1;jeten:1;<br /><br />If you would like to disable a vehicle, the last four enable each one. Change the number 1 to 0 for vehicles you do not want.<br /><br />Then, move the &quot;Base&quot; in the hirearchy to the place that you want it.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/45.png) <br /><br />Make sure it is above -300 in the Inspector on the Y axis or else you will fall off constantly.<br /><br />Another thing I recomond is creating a custom skybox. AWESOME skyboxes can be found here:<br /><br />http://www.redsorceress.com/skybox.html<br /><br />Once you download one that you like, import just like the textures. To make the textures look better, select one each individually and change their wrap mode from &quot;Repeat&quot; to &quot;Clamp.&quot;<br /><br />To set up the skybox, you need to create a material.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/55.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Select the new material and change it&#039;s render settings to a skybox.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/56.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Now you will see&nbsp; 6 areas for your skybox. Put each piece of the skybox into their designated areas.<br /><br />If you got a skybox from the site recommended above, you will NOT have a bottom texture, (Not a problem) and the LEFT and RIGHT images need to be switched. <br /><br />Now that your skybox is done, you need to have it displayed.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/57.png) <br /><br />And this will pop up:<br />&nbsp;<br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/58.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Make sure the skybox material is the skybox you created (Defaulted to &quot;New Material,&quot;) and go ahead and change the Fog Color to what ever you like.<br /><br />Now we need to adjust lighting. Create a directional light.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/54.png) <br /><br />Position it between you and the sun, then angle it so it is shinning right at you. This will make the terrain look like the light is coming from the skybox. Unfortunetly, I do not have a sun in my skybox, but it is in the right place due to the shading of the skybox.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/59.png) <br /><br />To make this take effect, create a lightmap.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/60.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />This will pop up and click OK.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/61.png) <br /><br />Once that is done, you are ready to export it. <br /><br />Part 4: Exporting <br /><br />If you don&#039;t have Unity Pro, create a package.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/48.png)<br /><br />Upload the package to Drop Box, and send it to me or someone else that has Unity Pro to export.<br /><br />If you have Unity Pro, or the Pro Trial, export it like this:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/49.png)<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/50.png)<br /><br />&nbsp;Make sure it says &quot;Bundle,&quot; then export it. The files will be located here:<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/51.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Upload EVERYTHING is there to Dropbox in it&#039;s own folder.<br /><br />(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/52.png)<br />&nbsp;<br />Once that is done, right click the following item to get your URL!<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14210843/World%20Tutorial%20Pictures/53.png)<br /><br />There you have it. That&#039;s how to make a world in Unity.&nbsp;
