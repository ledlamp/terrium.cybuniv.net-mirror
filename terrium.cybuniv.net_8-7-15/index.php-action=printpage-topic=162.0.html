				Two days ago (July 2nd, 2015) we went to the Habitat Restore (we also went yesterday but didn&#039;t really get anything). There were a lot of good stuff in and around the bin of free stuff. There were three big weatherproof utility boxes (brand new) and I got all of those, and there was also an outdoor table with a glass cover which we also got. I found an IKEA 11w CFL down at the bottom.<br /><br /><br />They recently reorganized their stuff and now it is terrible. Before there was a bin full of CFLs, a bin full of halogen bulbs, a bin full of giant metal halide bulbs and other HID bulbs, and lots of other good stuff. Now they don&#039;t have any of that stuff, and I could barely find any halogen bulbs anywhere! All they have now is a shelf with lots of crap bulbs but not much else. There were no low-voltage halogen bulbs anywhere which was what I was looking for. There were a bunch of high-voltage halogen bulbs though.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, right when we were about to leave, I looked through the bin of free stuff to find anything new, and right next to the bin the clerk was sorting through a paper bag of light bulbs. I immediately spotted a yellow bug light CFL&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; and other cool CFLS. Then she walked into the office/counter area (whatever it&#039;s called) for a moment, and then walked back and put some/most/all of the bulbs into the bin of free stuff!! YAY!! There was a 6-pack of 100 wat incandescent bulbs but I didn&#039;t take that. I took all the CFLs.<br /><br /><br />So these are the CFLs I got. These are the info directly copied from the text on the lamp.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>IKEA® ES0807G11 E26 11W 190mA 550lm 2700K AC120V/60Hz...</li><li>Philips Marathon™ Universal SLS 20W 120V 60Hz 285mA</li><li>GE 13W 120VAC 60Hz 200mA FLE13HT3/2/RVL; 800 LUMENS...</li><li>Commercial Electric ... SKU # 848-954; Model EXDA-13; 120V 60Hz 13W .180A (This is the yellow bug light bulb)</li><li>SATCO® Mini Spiral GU24 26W 2700K 120V 60Hz 410mA CRI 80 (I got two of these; one has a box)</li><li>SP 120V 60W KOREA (this is the frosted incandescent bulb)</li><li>GREENLITE 13W/ELS-M/Z 2700K; 120V 60Hz 220mA...

This was the first one I got. Interestingly I found another lamp just like this for sale on the shelf of light bulbs. Why did they give this one away for free but sell the other one? They&#039;re crazy.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/ydkan9aqv/IMG_0151.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/ydkan9aqv/)<br /><br /><br />Here is the yellow Commercial Electric anti-bug light. The tube inside wiggles around a bit when I shake it but that is no big deal. It appears to have been used a lot. This is an old one.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/4uksy00pz/IMG_0152.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/4uksy00pz/)(http://s23.postimg.org/tp4as2lk7/IMG_0153.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/tp4as2lk7/)<br /><br /><br />Here is the Philips Marathon lamp. Philips Marathon Universal bulbs like this are old and rather rare. They are very good quality and are notorious for long life.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/r92he83hj/IMG_0149.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/r92he83hj/)<br /><br /><br />Here is the GE 13w CFL. The top plastic part is blue which made me think it was a daylight CFL (high color temperature, cooler white) but it actually is not. It&#039;s probably a GE Reveal CFL so they make the top blue because the original GE Reveal incandescent bulbs were blue like that when off. So if this is a Reveal CFL then it probably has a higher color temperature than 2700K—probably 3000K.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/5duhl0hif/IMG_0150.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/5duhl0hif/)<br /><br /><br />Here are the Satco CFLs. I have two of these. They are GU24 bulbs but I don&#039;t have any GU24 sockets to use them yet. One of them does not have a box and one does. The one that does not have a box has had quite some use because the plastic is a bit yellowed. The other one appears to not have been used at all, or at least used very little. It is clean and has no yellowing or anything.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/3pvc6d3mv/IMG_0154.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/3pvc6d3mv/)(http://s23.postimg.org/9cwr0ych3/IMG_0167.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/9cwr0ych3/)(http://s23.postimg.org/i97j4w33b/IMG_0168.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/i97j4w33b/)(http://s23.postimg.org/7dg59ji5j/IMG_0169.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/7dg59ji5j/)(http://s23.postimg.org/dttpddg2v/IMG_0170.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/dttpddg2v/)(http://s23.postimg.org/lp48s6ppj/IMG_0173.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/lp48s6ppj/)<br /><br /><br />Here is the Greenlite CFL. Now here&#039;s something really interesting about this. On it there is a PG&amp;E sticker:<br />(http://s4.postimg.org/k18d4wcnh/pg_e_sticker.png)<br />Notice the date. This is from 2007. How interesting. So I guess this was a demo CFL to get people to use CFLs back in 2007?<br />Interesting thing about this bulb is that, for 13w, it outputs 900 lumens, and the tube is longer (making the spiral taller), and the bulb is a bit heavier than usual.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/lreh45xnr/IMG_0155.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/lreh45xnr/)(http://s23.postimg.org/dxdvirpuv/IMG_0156.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/dxdvirpuv/)(http://s23.postimg.org/8psseb99j/IMG_0157.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/8psseb99j/)(http://s23.postimg.org/mysewdns7/IMG_0158.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/mysewdns7/)(http://s23.postimg.org/cfxh4brfr/IMG_0159.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/cfxh4brfr/)<br /><br /><br />Now, here is the interesting bulb. This is the reason why I posted a post about light bulbs here on Terrium forums.<br />Well, this is a <strong>Cyber Lamp</strong>! Yep! Get it? It is related to me and Eric, because I am Lamp and Eric is TheCyberMan. It also has a relation to CarbonTech, because the company who made this is called <em><strong>Cyber Tech</strong></em>. Hehe! How cool is that!<br />Here is their website: http://www.cybertechlighting.com/<br />Another cool thing about this CFL is that it is 4100K (called Daylight or Cool White). Daylight CFLs are kinda rare. The most popular is soft white/warm white (2700K) which is what you see everywhere. It is a yellowish white, and daylight is a bluish white.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/6z9rctrqf/IMG_0160.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/6z9rctrqf/)(http://s23.postimg.org/hong533jb/IMG_0161.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/hong533jb/)(http://s23.postimg.org/ej7wbzr8n/IMG_0162.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/ej7wbzr8n/)(http://s23.postimg.org/vjlqnjxyf/IMG_0163.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/vjlqnjxyf/)(http://s23.postimg.org/5s0vhq7xj/IMG_0164.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/5s0vhq7xj/)(http://s23.postimg.org/6y4vgiw87/IMG_0165.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/6y4vgiw87/)<br /><br /><br />And we also got one incandescent bulb. This is a 60w frosted candelabra bulb.<br />(http://s23.postimg.org/3sk9qbdlz/IMG_0166.jpg) (http://postimg.org/image/3sk9qbdlz/)<br /><br /><br /><hr /><br />Also, here&#039;s something interesting. I was taking the pictures under the full sun with the iPod, and after a while the iPod overheated and said it was too hot and bla bla bla. Wow, anything dark will absorb so much heat from the sun and become so hot! Hot enough to burn yourself!<br />That is why you never walk on a street with bare feet in the middle of a summer day.

See, CFLs are dirt cheap now and are often given away for free because many people are switching to LEDs making CFLs &quot;old technology&quot; and people are getting rid of them. And also because there have been tons of CFLs produced, but if LED lamps weren&#039;t popular or didn&#039;t even exist, CFLs would be worth more because they are the latest technology.<br /><br />But CFLs aren&#039;t really bad. LEDs aren&#039;t much more efficient than CFLs, so CFLs are a really cheap and easy way to get a lot of light! Only problem with them is that they contain mercury which is why many people don&#039;t want them, but that is ok as long as you be careful.
