				Hey<br /><br />Since Mars is broken, this looks like the most viable alternative.&nbsp; It looks a lot nicer than Mars, great work on the polishing.&nbsp; However, it seems to have lost some key features, such as server settings and custom worlds.&nbsp; Also, when your underwater all you see is a missing texture/shader pink.&nbsp; Great job so far though!<br /><br />I&#039;d be glad to help in anyway I can.&nbsp; I have experience in coding in C++ and ObjC, I can do 3D modeling in Blender, and I am proficient in GIMP, but I do not have much experience with Unity.&nbsp; Mars was great and I hope Terrium gets to be even better :D

				The server setting are removed due to very glitchy GUI (for now)<br />I talked to Eric a long time ago about making their removal permanent (so server settings are set by world creators, not the host) but I don&#039;t remember where that went.<br /><br />I believe I left custom worlds in the &quot;advanced&quot; tab in the world menu (bottom left, just above the world names) but if I didn&#039;t, I can fix that :)<br /><br />The whirld system is set to be replaced by a system I&#039;m working on right now, which will not require Unity Pro to export... In fact, it won&#039;t even require Unity! Though direct-from-editor exports are something it will be able to do.<br /><br />Your offer of help is appreciated, but most of the programming and 3D modelling has been done&nbsp; by now. The most helpful job that you can do right now is find more things like the pink underwater surface you mentioned (which I&#039;ll look into asap) as Eric and I can&#039;t spot everything. :P<br /><br />Thanks for your kind words!
