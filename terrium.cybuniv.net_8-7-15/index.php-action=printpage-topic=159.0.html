				Dearest Terrians,<br /><br /><br />First of all, I wish to thank you for taking the time to check on Terrium&#039;s status and keep this forum alive. I am happy to report that, as of today, Terrium&#039;s summer development has officially started.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our lead programmer, Arthur, has been on an indefinite leave of absence due to personal issues, and he may not return as a developer. Despite this loss, Terrium remains in competent and hard-working hands. I have personally hired a freelance developer to help us with the demanding work required to complete our goal for this summer—to release Terrium Beta 1.0. A friend of mine, Roe (http://terrium.cybuniv.net/index.php?action=profile;u=96), will also be available for freelance web development when it comes time to improving the site and other back-end projects. <br /><br />As we progress throughout the rewrite, I will try to keep you all better posted on milestones during development. I cannot wait to play this game with you all!<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><br />Eric

				Woo hoo!!!<br /><br />But just now I was recording a video of multiplayer but it actually was not recording so I missed a whole lot of great and funny footage. I found out that tanks are really lightweight and lasers make them fly and I had a really fun tank fight with Fios, and we also discovered flying hovercrafts, and at the end fios glitched and there were two fioses and one Fios buggy was humping the other Fios buggy (REALLY IT ACTUALLY WAS! ROFLMAO!!!) but I found that that all this time IT WAS NOT RECORDING!!! (click first and second link)<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/6615s8ji5/ (http://postimg.org/image/6615s8ji5/)<br />http://postimg.org/image/yw4oj9r7f/ (http://postimg.org/image/yw4oj9r7f/)<br /><br />yeah&nbsp; I know this is probably off-topic of this thread but I didn&#039;t want to make a new thread... whatever anyway but this is great news and terrium really has a bright future. Just really sucks my recording wasn&#039;t recording. (click second link).<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:P haha waah I&#039;m half sad and half happy because this is a nice post but my recording didnt work :S

				You and Roe founded Roe host? Interesting. Just the two of you?<br />Someone could use Roe host to host a 24/7 Terrium server.<br /><br />OOH OOH I HAVE AN IDEA! Dedicated servers for Terrium. Like in Bitfighter. So people can host 24/7 servers without having to have their whole client, and player, in it. And, how bout each dedicated server have its own world list with other worlds that are not on the default list? Just like Bitfighter!! And Minecraft!!&nbsp; ;D <br /><br /><br />Hehe https://roehost.net/About/Eric (https://roehost.net/About/Eric)<br />Terrium will be linked to a huge hosting company!&nbsp; 8) <br />Those staff avatars are creepy though&nbsp; :o&nbsp; Really.... really creepy... uhm... <br />Also I found a problem on the about page (https://roehost.net/about), Eric&#039;s (creepy) avatar doesn&#039;t show up on the list. It&#039;s just blank.<br />Once again..... those avatars. are. freaking. me. out. @-@&nbsp; x-x<br /><br />It looks like those avatars were made by someone called Smajor.<br />(http://s3.postimg.org/dr6j00vr3/Screen_Shot_2015_07_01_at_7_37_21_PM.png)<br /><br />ANYWAY.....<br />I wonder if that $3/month web hosting plan would be enough to run a Terrium server. Don&#039;t know if 5GB of bandwidth per month would handle the server though. But for 50% more you can get 3x bandwitdh.

				Tangential update: Roe and I have decided to shut down ROE Host in order to focus our efforts on other more promising and less draining endeavors, such as Terrium. Additionally, Roe will be a freelance auxiliary web developer for Terrium rather than a game programmer.<br /><br />With regard to Terrium, I regret to inform you that Arthur will not be returning as a developer. Development is going very well, though, and I will post an update on Terrium&#039;s progress soon. Stay tuned!
