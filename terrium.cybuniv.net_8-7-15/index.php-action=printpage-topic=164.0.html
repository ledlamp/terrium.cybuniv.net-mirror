				Title: <strong>Chase game</strong><br />

				Me and Fios have invented a fun game to play in Terrium.<br />It&#039;s called Chase and it is self-explanatory.<br /><br />Here is how to play:<br /><br /><br />This is a two-player game. I don&#039;t know if it would work with 3 players.<br /><br /><br />First start a game in Ace&#039;s Canyon. Ace&#039;s Canyon is the best world for playing chase, but if you want to experiment you can try other worlds.<br /><br /><br />Now, the goal of the game is very simple. All you do is chase the quarry and try to get quarry. Then when you are quarry, the opponent will chase you.<br /><br /><br />When you are quarry, run away from the opponent to try to prevent them from catching you.<br />When the opponent catches you and becomes quarry, the roles reverse, and you chase the opponent while they try to avoid you.<br /><br /><br />You can fly, but try not to fly too much. Just sometimes fly to dart or keep on the ground or to bridge gaps. This is supposed to be chasing, not dogfighting. But you could occasionally start a short dogfight, then get back to chasing.<br /><br /><br />You are allowed to shoot as much as you want.<br /><br /><br />And that is pretty much all. If you want there to be an ending, you can set a max score, so the first person to reach that score will win. Or, you could use timers, and measure the amount of time each person has quarry, and the first person to reach the max wins.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This game works very well in Terrium because of Terrium&#039;s wonky physics. It&#039;s challenging to keep your buggy going straight because the buggy tends to spin out of control (like if you were driving backwards). You can take advantage of this by darting the other direction as soon as you spin 180&#730; so you zoom past your opponent in the opposite direction so they have to turn around.<br />Also, the buggies take a long time to accelerate, so when you spin out of control, it takes a while to get back on track. And once you&#039;re at full speed, it&#039;s fun, and challenging because you have to try and keep your speed without loosing it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We think this should be one of the game modes to choose, so there could be special features in the game just for chasing.<br /><br /><br />Here is a video of me playing chase with firespeed:<br />http://youtu.be/w2L_JhR8bLs (http://youtu.be/w2L_JhR8bLs)<br />It didn&#039;t come out very well because after I started recording, Terrium was a bit more laggy for me, and also firespeed started glitching making it hard to shoot him. But it still shows you how it works.

				This would be a great gamemode in Terrium! Though I have a few more suggestions.<br /><br />With 3+ players you can have two chasers and one quarry (which will be a big challenge for the quarry), or you could have two quarrys for the chaser to chase (which will be a big challenge for the chaser).<br /><br />This gamemode will be compatible with every map.<br /><br />Maybe you shouldn&#039;t fly at all?&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />

				&quot;You are allowed to shoot as much as you want.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand how this is any different than laser tag, then. What would you want different from the game mode we offer already?

				Eric&#039;s right, it&#039;s not much different then regular laser tag, but if you join a game and say lets play chase it seems to snap people out of noob mode and into competitive mode.<br />I guess it&#039;s like desert rats that Kruncher would host.<br /><br />And I agree no wings is best for this mode.
