				After trying this game out with (Cxpw426)+ I have come up some things that SHOULD be changed that I think will make the game a lot better (I know it&#039;s only in beta).<br /><br />1. The Jet and the Buggy need to be much more agile.<br /><br />2. Jet should have 2 different landing gear, the one that it has right now and the old one from Mars Explorer.<br /><br />3. I really think you should removed the redness of the cockpit when in Gyride.<br /><br />4. The water in Ace&#039;s Canyon is really glitchy, Jets get stuck in them and can never get out. It also moves by itself (like it&#039;s vibrating), and it doesn&#039;t look like water at all, it&#039;s silver.<br /><br />5. The green laser sound should be more high pitched and the red laser should be more deep.<br /><br />6. The speed on ALL vehicles feels VERY weird. 400 MPH feels more like 50 MPH.<br /><br />7. The Buggy needs less traction.<br /><br />8. The spawn point in Ace&#039;s Canyon is to high up so if you&#039;re on the ground you can&#039;t change vehicles (it&#039;s very hard even when your a Glider).<br /><br />9. Where&#039;s the automatic laser-lock on the Jet?<br /><br />10. PLEASE add the airbrake in the game! It&#039;s killing me! Make sure it&#039;s middle mouse button.<br /><br />11. More music variety.<br /><br />12. Less impact radius on the red laser.<br /><br />13. The turning speed is terrible. Make turning faster.<br /><br />14. Gliding feels weird (the speed, turning, and things like that).<br /><br />15. The Tank colors don&#039;t really go with all the other vehicle colors and/or design (in my opinion).<br /><br />16. Make this game compatible with Chrome.<br /><br />17. I have been reading what the other players want in this game. I want it too!<br /><br />18. How will you incorporate money in this game? It&#039;s in the description.<br /><br />19. Put Server Settings in!<br /><br />20. The acceleration on the Buggy and Jet is really annoying. They&#039;re so slow! <br /><br />21. Please make it that the player limit is more than 10. I want BIG battles! Maybe team skirmishes?<br /><br />22. When a Tank gets shot (Tank Battles) they literally fly into the air.<br /><br />23. When a Tank joins the game, the FPS drops from 50 to 10 in a second. Example: 2 Buggies + 1 Tank&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />24. Something is wrong with this text thing... When you type a letter the next letter is deleted.<br /><br />25. Console Commands?<br /><br />26. Move the Messaging Console to the left like Mars Explorer&#039;s, also don&#039;t make it a pop-up.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I have to say right now. I know you guys are short on programmers and/or developers in this game so don&#039;t take this like your game sucks. I like the new models and the worlds, this game can be very good once you guys fix some stuff.

				<br />Devs can&#039;t do anything about the compatibility with Chrome. It&#039;s up to Unity to release Unity 5 that uses the new Pepper Plugin API. But this won&#039;t be a problem with the standalone applications which will be available when terrium is released.<br /><br /><br />More gamemodes are certainly coming... that&#039;s why there&#039;s a selector there already.<br /><br /><br />Also, add to your list that the Terrium buggy is so dang sluggish. Takes ages to get up to speed. Makes the buggy feel like it is very heavy (is it supposed to be?).<br /><br /><br />And yes, it really does need to have less traction. The traction is so high that you can drive on the walls and even the ceiling! LOL!&nbsp; ;D
