				Hello!<br /><br /><br />I am aware that no-one has had any updates from the development team since Eric and I stopped updating the forums on Mars. Well... here&#039;s some information for you.<br /><br /><br />Firstly, the reason we&#039;ve had very slow progress: vacations. Eric&#039;s been away for a few weeks, and has hardly been around over the past month. GTR vanished part-way through making the new tank, in order to &quot;set up for college&quot; if I remember correctly - which is a fair excuse. So that&#039;s left me alone to work on the project, and I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;ve taken a few breaks of one or two days every now and again.<br /><br /><br />The current status: Well... basic networking works. Positions sync across all computers in a server, and lasers fire when (and sometimes where) they&#039;re supposed to. The physics of the buggy has been revamped a few times, to make it more realistic and to improve high-speed handling.<br /><br /><br />And the future: Rather than type out a lengthy statement, I&#039;m just going to paste our current ToDo list. It&#039;s a very short-term thing. I personally hope to have all the things mentioned on it checked off by the end of the month.<br /><br /><br /><br />Networking:<br />1. Reported not working. Unlikely to be the case but I want to check over it, just in case.<br />2. Lasers - collision and sync is not working<br />3. Glitchy collision physics? Needs looking into, again.<br /><br /><br />3D Modeling:<br />1. Buggy needs a floor &#8730; (Done)<br />2. Tank needs finishing<br />3. Jet needs starting<br /><br /><br />Graphics:<br />1. Underwater effects needed<br /><br /><br />Music:<br />1. Finish Menu Piece<br />2. Start Theme Piece<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, I&#039;m quitting development for a few months, starting from September, for exams. I&#039;ll be back after the exam period, which means I&#039;ll be working again in December, hopefully.<br /><br /><br />In the meantime, we continue to update the Alpha build (available on the cybuniv site, just follow the signs). :)

				Greetings everyone! I have returned from all of my travels that spanned nearly a month this summer. <br /><br />Status update: ACE has finished basic networking, GTR34 is now working on the tank and jet models, Charles has been finishing up his two pieces of music,&nbsp; and I have a few minor things to do for the Terrium forum and game. Fortunately, the Terrium&#039;s networking, graphics, and the website are, for the most part, ready for the release.
