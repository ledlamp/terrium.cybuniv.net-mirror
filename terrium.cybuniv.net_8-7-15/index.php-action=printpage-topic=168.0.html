				Hey everyone,<br /><br />With a fresh rewrite for Terrium comes a brand new forum. I purchased a new server on DigitalOcean on which to host our new site. I also purchased the XenForo forum software, installed it, and set it up with some boards. Now it is time to begin the migration. For those of you still around, please re-register and start posting on the new forum: http://terrium.net (http://terrium.net)<br /><br />Terrium.net is currently using a default template, but will have a custom template soon enough, and it will look EPIC.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Eric

				The new forum isn&#039;t working.<br /><br />It won&#039;t load; it just hangs there and it also causes the previous tab to freeze too.<br /><br /><hr /><br />Are you going to migrate all the posts and content to the new forum?? I really hope you are! You have to!

So, before starting work on the new forum design, I decided to switch forum softwares sooner than later. Here are a few new things that XenForo offers:<br /><br />1. HTML 5 + Responsiveness <br />2. A more clean and modern feel. Like a social network.<br />3. Add-ons rarely interfere<br />4. Better SEO friendly features<br />5. Faster performance<br />6. Constantly coming out with new updates . . . XenForo 2.0 sounds very promising.<br />7. Support for mobile devices<br />8. Extensive built-in spam fighting features<br />9. Easy template design
