				Firstly, I&#039;d like to thank Eric for making it possible for me to post again :D<br /><br />The source code is now here!<br /><br />A few things before you attempt to run it - firstly, the multitudes of errors are all ok. Unity tells you that you can&#039;t call RandomRangeInt outside the main thread; well, you can. The other error - concerning colours - is stupid too, it finds the material colour needed then reports that it doesn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />One last thing: if you choose to test-run this in the editor (or in a build) DO NOT use the &quot;Stop Hosting&quot; button to leave a world, always use the editor&#039;s play button (or command/control-q in an application). If you press the button, the game/editor will freeze. This is because it tries to disconnect from a master server it never connected to.<br /><br />So, here&#039;s the product:<br /><br />https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqpo89jpxes57s7/Mars%20Explorer%202.5%20Source.zip (https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqpo89jpxes57s7/Mars%20Explorer%202.5%20Source.zip)<br /><br />Enjoy, it should run happily in Unity 4. Feel free to modify to your heart&#039;s content, and don&#039;t forget that the worlds are now cached when you load them.<br /><br />Credit goes to:<br />- Eric, for being a fantastic project leader, and for working on the code<br />- _ACE_ (me!), for fixing and modifying whirld (and otherwise just coding)<br />- Abister, for testing the project on his Windows machine just before the release… the cache wouldn&#039;t work on Windows but for his help.<br />- The members of the Mars Skype group, for their support and feedback<br />- The Mars community, for putting up with us<br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns about the code, please send me a PM, I&#039;ll be glad to help wherever I can.

				I downloaded this and downloaded Unity 4.5, and built a webplayer, and many features do not work<br />https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5925020/Webplayers/marsxplr2.5.html<br /><br />When I run it from the local path (file:///) it works better, but if i run it from the above link, the world list doesnt even show up.<br /><br />On local path the terrains do not work, only block worlds.<br /><br />Also a problem with your world caching thing is that it only saves the Whirld.utw file but not the Assets.unity3d file. Maybe this is because it does not load it or something which is why terrain worlds do not work, because the assets file holds all the terrain, images, sound, etc stuff, while the utw file only holds some settings, location of assets, and block world data.

At the time when the source was posted, that was the latest version.<br />I&#039;ll look at your web player later today.<br /><br /><br />Apologies for not updating this page to reflect Unity-made changes.
