				First question - for the sake of other people as well as myself - could someone clarify the use of the Rep buttons? I&#039;m pretty sure adding Rep is for good posts, but in what situation is a down-rep needed? (ie why is my rep -2?)

				I&#039;m GUESSING it&#039;s like the upvote/downvote system, but doesn&#039;t move the most upvoted comments and posts to the top so they&#039;re more easily accessible.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s more like a competition or something.

				It is better because:<br />- It is under active development<br />- The networking is more stable (although some glitches exist, you never get &quot;No Connection&quot; issues)<br />- It features better graphics<br /><br />- The planned features include CTF and other &quot;modes,&quot; and a world creator that does not require unity pro.<br /><br />So the short answer? It&#039;s an extended, reworked Mars Explorer.

However this relies on a separate project (my non-pro whirld-esque map creator/editor system).<br /><br />Unity, having promised to always support old versions of asset bundles, changed the format. Now we can&#039;t load whirlds exported before Unity 4.5 - which was most, if not all, of them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been exporting most worlds we can find, having patched the Whirld exporter to work in Unity 4.5. If anyone wants to get their hands on the fixed Whirld exporter and send us their worlds they are most welcome to it.<br /><br />That&#039;s why we asked you for you project files, Gub. We want to have as many of the &quot;classic&quot; worlds as possible for the first release.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a new world, too. I believe Eric and GTR intend to as well.<br /><br />My exporter is coming soon™ so if anyone out there doesn&#039;t have Unity Pro but wants to make a high-quality world for Terrium, it will be possible :)

				Heyyo! It&#039;s me, Emperor Ectoshock! Alright, so I just recently started playing Terrium, and... I gotta say, the visualness of it all is MIND-BLOWING.<br /><br />HOWEVER. I have 3 questions that I desperately need answered.<br /><br />1) How the hell do you work the Jet? The jet is my most favored vehicle, but I can&#039;t control it at all. It&#039;s so difficult, &#039;cause I don&#039;t know if it works like the old Mars jet or not.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />2) How do I post a.. well, a post, on the forum? I&#039;d like to know just in case I ever do need to post something important.<br /><br />3) Is Terrium still being worked on? &#039;Cause even though most of us is busy, Terrium seems absolutely amazing and I do sincerly hope that modifications are still being processed as we speak.<br /><br />It&#039;s good to see all y&#039;all again, and I hope we all can start playing Terrium more frequently!<br /><br />~ &#8721;.&#8721;

However, I cannot develop as I once did - my Unity Pro trial ran out a few days ago, and not only is it technically against the T&amp;Cs to use non-pro Unity with a Unity Pro project, but it also risks corrupting files. Never fear - I&#039;m working on more cool games for Cybuniv right now, while Eric is finishing Terrium off. It should be ready very soon!<br /><br /><br />May I ask what specific &quot;modifications&quot; you&#039;d want to see? I don&#039;t remember what version is online right now (I suspect an older one) but in general we&#039;re just bugfixing.<br /><br /><br />Also, try pressing space on all the vehicles - not just the jet and buggy. The Jet&#039;s hovering is still there... Just on a different vehicle ;)

				Ahh... wonderful. Thank you, ACE!<br /><br />And the only modifications I mean is you know, the additions of worlds or other worlds that were meant to be exported but never got to.<br /><br />Also, is it possible that, temporarily, the Jet&#039;s functions can return to how it originally is in Mars Explorer?

				Ahh. Alright.<br /><br />I just wish it was a little easier to get into the air like before.<br /><br />I had tested out the Jet last night on Unity Island, and I finally got it to work for me once I rode it up the big hill and fell off so I could get some aerial momentum. Once I finally got it into the air, it flew like a dream. Could still use more handling, but yeah.<br /><br />Oh, and the functions of the Hovercraft still bewilder me. I&#039;m just trying to find someway to get it higher in the air, and trying to make it go faster &#039;cause it doesn&#039;t seem as fast as the old Hovercraft. But, I guess that will all come in due time once y&#039;all make players able to use Server Settings again.<br /><br />Speaking of which, when will Server Settings be available - when the game reaches its final development?

There are a lot of maps where the Jet is just a pain to take off with, some where it&#039;s impossible. This is intentional.<br />&quot;more handling&quot;? I assume you mean you want us to increase the agility of the jet... We could do that but it would likely end up difficult to fly; the inertia isn&#039;t going to go anywhere, so being able to pitch back faster will simply lead to a stall.<br /><br />Hovercraft: sounds like you were in vertical-flight mode in the hovercraft. Toggle between vertical flight and horizontal flight with spacebar. also, Q and E make you go up. And X or C is your brake (iirc).<br /><br />Server settings: probably will stay hidden. They&#039;re actuallt still there just inaccessible to players. However, they will be included in map files - so map creators can mess with physics all they want, but at the same time actually design worlds to fit the physics, too.<br /><br />Super-tanks, inverted gravity and unstable buggies were amusing, but Terrium isn&#039;t intended as a physics sandbox game. So, &quot;Server Settings&quot; are (hopefully) gone for good.<br />

Someone could hate a person even if that person makes good content, and vice-versa. If they were to follow the idea of giving positive reputation for good content, then they would +1 people who make good content even if they hate them. If they were to follow the idea of giving positive reputation based on whether they like them or not, then they would -1 that person even though that person made good content.
